Documentation for CRA with Eslint using Airbnb and Prettier

CRA (Create React App) is a great way to start building a new React project quickly. Eslint is a popular tool for linting JavaScript code, and Airbnb provides a widely-used set of style guidelines. Prettier is a code formatter that can be integrated with Eslint. Here are the steps to configure your CRA project with Eslint using Airbnb and Prettier:

1. Create React App already comes with ESLint, so we need only to extend its configuration. In your project, use the following command to install the peer dependencies required for Airbnb configuration:

```
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb
```

2. Initialize Eslint: Use the following command to initialize Eslint configuration:

```
eslint --init
```

Answer the questions as per your requirement. You can choose "React" as a framework while configuring.

3. Use the following commands to set up Prettier:

```
npm install prettier --save-dev
npm install eslint-config-prettier --save-dev
npm install eslint-plugin-prettier --save-dev
```

6. Update the .eslintrc.json file in your project root directory with the following content:

```
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es2021": true
  },
  "extends": [
    "react-app",
    "react-app/jest",
    "airbnb",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
    "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended",
    "plugin:prettier/recommended"
  ],
  "overrides": [],
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": "latest",
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "plugins": ["react"],
  "rules": {
    "react/jsx-filename-extension": [1, { "extensions": [".js", ".jsx"] }],
    "prettier/prettier": [
      "error",
      {
        "semi": false,
        "singleQuote": true,
        "trailingComma": "none"
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

This configuration extends the "airbnb" rules and also includes the "prettier" plugin for formatting.

7. Use the following commands to run Eslint and Prettier:

```
npx prettier --write .
eslint .
eslint . --fix
```

This command will format all files in the project using Prettier, then run Eslint to check for any linting errors and then --fix will automatically fix some of the linting errors for you.

In the case of a Create React App project, where the source files are typically located in the src directory, running eslint src is a good option to limit eslint to only the source files in your project.

```
eslint src
```

8. Merge Prettier configurations: If you want to merge and override any config set with .prettierrc files, use the following option in your .eslintrc.json file:

```
{
  "prettier/prettier": [
    "error",
    {
      "singleQuote": true,
      "parser": "flow"
    }
  ]
}
```

That's it! Your CRA project is now configured with Eslint using Airbnb and Prettier.
